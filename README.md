Project for TOP.

Notes:
  Try not to get too caught up on styling before the javascript is all complete.
Just makes things more confusing.
  Try to organize everything into objects. Makes the code more readable.
  Need to work on organizing my dom manip better.
  Everything about printing to the browser should be its own object/set of
objects. The bulk of the code should not be too tightly coupled with what is 
going on in the browser.
